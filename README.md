# Accenture North America Data Analytics and Visualization Job Simulation - November 2023

Welcome to the repository for the Accenture North America Data Analytics and Visualization Job Simulation on Forage, completed in November 2023. This simulation focused on advising a hypothetical social media client as a Data Analyst at Accenture. The following outlines the key aspects of the simulation:

## Project Overview

As part of this simulation, I undertook the role of a Data Analyst at Accenture, working on a project for a social media client. The primary objectives were to analyze and derive insights from seven datasets related to content trends and use the findings to inform strategic decision-making.

## Key Achievements

- **Data Cleaning and Modeling:** Successfully cleaned and modeled seven datasets to ensure accurate and reliable analysis.

- **In-depth Analysis:** Conducted a comprehensive analysis to uncover insights into content trends, allowing for a better understanding of user behavior and preferences.

- **Strategic Decision Support:** Provided valuable insights to aid in strategic decision-making for the client.

- **Visualization:** Prepared a PowerPoint deck and a video presentation to effectively communicate key findings to both the client and internal stakeholders.

## Data Insights

At 2,138, May had the highest Count of Content ID, representing an 11.70% increase compared to February, which had the lowest Count of Content ID at 1,914.
